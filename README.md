## Description

The main purpose of this study is to gauge participant’s risk seeking and risk averse behavior. When participants click the button to start the game, they are first asked to indicate their sociodemographic background, such as, age, sex, and highest education level. They are then directed to the mood assessment survey where they indicate how they are feeling at the moment. Participants will take a fake questionnaire to divert their attention from the main purpose of the study. After completing the fake questionnaire, they will complete the writing task, mood assessment 2, and lottery game. 

The core of this survey experiment is a lottery game to test risk taking behavior (single player).

Prior to that participants are asked to provide sociodemographic information known to be related to gambling behavior and decision making (e.g. age, gender, income proxys).
I  a next step participants will have to solve a writing task where they have to write about their own experiences where they felt angry, sad, scared.
Beofre and after this writing task the particpicants' mood is asked for. 

## Theoretical background 

What the authors of this game are interested in is the association of emotions and risk behavior. The question under research is how specific emotions affect risk decisions in online environments.
The most famous theory of explaining decision making under uncertainty is [Prospect Theory] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) (Kahneman & Tversky 1979). Prospect Theory (PT) constitutes an alternative to Expected Utility Theory, which models decision making of perfectly rational agents and states that choices are made with regards to their maximum utility. The starting point of PT, however, is the concept of loss aversion, stating that people have a tendency to weigh losses more heavily than gains (e.g. gaining 100$ has a lower psychological value than losing 100$). Another feature of PT is the assumption that people are not either risk-averse or risk-seeking, but rather that they can be both: risk-averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses. One implication of prospect theory thus is that risky decisions are driven by framing effects.

Literature shows that emotions have an additional effect on decision making. [Vampos-Vazquez and Cuilty (2014)] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804314000196), by performing experiments in school classes, were able to show that sadness increases risk aversion (in gain frame) and that anger increases decreases loss aversion and thus triggers risk-loving behavior. Kugler et al. (2012) found results for feelings of fear, where people became more risk averse. They also found anger to be negatively influencing risk aversion. Baumann and DeSteno (2012) corroborate these findings, by finding that anger increases risky choices.

This game thus seeks to replicate prior research and corroborate to them by apllying the mean idea to an online environment.

From literature the following hypotheses are derived:

Assumption: People in the control condition (no emotional framing) are risk averse (in win frame) (% of people deciding risk-averse -> baseline)

H1: Framing participants on sadness increases their risk aversion

H2: Framing participants on anger increases their risk affinity

H3: Framing participants on fear increases their risk aversion

Participants are able to complete the experiment from any location in their own time.
